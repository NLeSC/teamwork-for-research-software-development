This lesson teaches how to successfully work together in a team.
It is geared primarily towards people that create research software in an academic setting, however the lesson is most likely also useful for anyone trying to work on a team in scientific projects. Finally we hope that anyone wanting to get better at working in teams can learn something from this lesson.

The widespread standard in academia has been, and still is,
to work individually for the majority of one's time.
However, if done well, working in a team can be
more fun, more productive, and more effective.

We start with discussing the benefits and downsides of working in teams.
Next, we introduce the Agile way of working, a useful set of guidelines for effective teamwork.
We learn about Scrum and Kanban, which are popular practical implementations of the Agile principles.
We finish with discussing challenges of working in teams in a research environment and
exchange practical recommendations for teamwork.

Upon completion of this lesson you will have a set of tools that help you
work in teams more effectively, productively, and enjoyably.
