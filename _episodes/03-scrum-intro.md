> ## Discussion
> Think about following the Scrum methodology when working on your projects in a team.
> - What questions do you still have?
> - Are there any incremental improvements that can benefit your team?
> - What did you learn in the online course that you think is too much for your team?

The [Scrum guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide) prescribes in the first chapter that one should either do Scrum completely, or not do Scrum: 

> *Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. 
> Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, 
> covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.*
> 
> ~ The Scrum Guide

Failure of a team doing Scrum is often blamed upon them not following the actual Scrum rules.

> ## Discussion
> Discuss with your team about the "all or nothing" statement in Scrum. Do you understand why it is there?
> Do you agree with this statement?
{: .discussion}

From experience we know that following the exact Scrum rules not always fits a team well as the team might be bounded by other restrictions. We will go deeper into the specific challenges that we run into when we want to do scientific research within a team. We will first discuss a different Agile implementation, called Kanban in the next episode.
