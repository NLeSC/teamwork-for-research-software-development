Our tips:
- **Any mutation to the team makes a new team.** Whenever a team member leaves or is added to the team,
you should treat this as the start of a new team.
- **Teams need a coach.** Self-organization of teams doesn't happen automatically.
It can be very beneficial to have someone in or close to the team that can coach the
team in the right direction.
- **Invest in soft skills.** Certain soft skills are vital for teamwork, see below.

These are some important soft skills needed in teams:
### Giving good feedback
Learning from each other is one of the benefits of team work.
For this, giving good feedback is vital.
#### How to give good feedback?
* Make it specific
* Give feedback from your perspective. Feedback is always subjective.
* Don't wait too long with giving feedback.
* Stay positive. A good rule is to always start with something positive.
* Prepare your comments.
#### How to receive feedback?
* Don't feel attacked. The person giving you feedback is trying to help you.
* Ask for clarification if the feedback is not specific enough.

### Build trust
Trust between team members is important for:
* Trusting each other to successfully finish tasks
* Giving good feedback to each other.
And counting on feedback to be given to you in case of failure.
#### How to build trust in a team?
* Create a safe environment for failures. Don't blame people personally.
* Admit when you don't know something.
* Give praise, better too often than too seldomly.

### Be inclusive
Inclusivity is when individuals with different identities
and backgrounds are welcomed in a group setting.
It is good to be aware of this in a team.
#### Tips for being inclusive
* Dare to speak up if you feel someone is left out.
If done constructively, this is usually appreciated by everyone.
* Acknowledge that you have an unconscious bias.
* Try to imagine yourself being in the place of your team members.
* Having trust in the team helps (see above).

### Team bonding
This may sound trivial, but don't underestimate the importance of team bonding.
It really helps to step out of the formal office setting,
and improve the relationships in the team over a drink, doing a sports activity, or solving
an escape room together.

# Wrapping up
