Our recommendations:
- **Any mutation to the team makes a new team.** Whenever a team member leaves or is added to the team,
you should treat this as the start of a new team.
- **Teams need a coach.** Self-organization of teams doesn't happen automatically.
It can be very beneficial to have someone in or close to the team that can coach the
team in the right direction.
- **Invest in soft skills.** Certain soft skills are vital for teamwork, see below.

# Soft skills

> ## Discussion: soft skills
