## What is Kanban?

Kanban is a process managemnet method. It balances demands with available
capacity and improves the handling of bottelnecks. You can simply apply Kanban to
your current process of developing software.

You may often hear that Kanban is a `pull` system. It means that a new work-item
is pulled to the process as capacity permits. We will explain this in the next
section where we introduce a Kanban board.

## What is a Kanban board?

A kanban board is a project management tool designed to visualize process,
define tasks, and manage backlog-items. It helps to show/record `what`, `how`
and `who` aspects of a work-item and keep everyone on the same page. A Kanban
board uses cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help teams commit to
the right amount of work, and get it done!

### Cards

Team members devide the work into some work-items and write onto cards
(stickies, or tickets), usually one per card. For Agile teams, each card could
represent one user story. Once on the board, these cards help everyone
understand what the team is working on.

### Columns

### Continuous improvement
