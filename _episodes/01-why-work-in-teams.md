## Introduction

In this episode we will learn about teams and discuss why you should want to
work in a team in the first place. To define a team, it is useful to look at
teams in a continuum and think about the difference between a team and just any
group of people:

- Any gathering of people: they might not even know or see each other, nor
  necessarily share common interests.
- Groups: they are aware of each other and may interact, more than a
  simple gathering of people.
- Working group: a group with at least some common goals.
- Team: a group of people who act together to achieve common goals. Often,
  a group of individuals first form a working group. Then, they become a team.

There are many benefits of working in teams, but there are clearly also some downsides.
The key is to work together in such a way that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
An agile way of working can help with this!
