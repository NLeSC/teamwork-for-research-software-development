-----------------------------------------------
### Uncertainty Challenge
When doing science, the time required to implement a solution is ambiguous and depends on unknowns such as
outcomes of investigations and experiments or data availability.

#### Solutions:
- **Use *spikes***: The team could create *spikes*: items in the backlog that
provide time for research and discovery.
They are either timeboxed or their definition of done is when the specified research objectives are met.
- **Do the least understood work first**: Start with the most uncertain tasks and increment from there.
- **Deviate from the plan**: The sprint plan is not set in stone,
teams should 'negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog' when needed.
- **Relax "Definition of Done"**: To keep a fast discovery pace,
exploratory work doesn't need to meet the same strict criteria as regular tasks.
------------------------------------------------
### Distributed expertise challenge
In Agile methodologies it is often assumed that a task can be picked up by any team member.
However, in science different team members often have specialized in certain domains or technologies,
and it makes more sense to assign specific tasks to members with a specific expertise.

#### Solutions:
-
----------------------------------------------------
### Cultural challenge
A scientist is traditionally used to working in an isolated silo.
Also management might be hesitant to let teams self-manage.

#### Solutions:
- **Implement flexibly**: You should fit the methodology to the way of working.
'Process-rigidity is the antithesis of agility.'
- **Emphasize the "why"**: Focus on the "why" for the change to agile instead of
"what" to do to make the change.
----------------------------------------------------
### Waterfall project setup challenge
Scientific projects are often setup in long-term project timelines following a
Waterfall method.
#### Solutions:
-
----------------------------------------------------
### Team dedication challenge

#### Solutions:
-
