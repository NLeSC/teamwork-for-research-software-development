-----------------------------------------------
### Uncertainty Challenge
When doing science, the time required to implement a solution is ambiguous and depends on unknowns such as
outcomes of investigations and experiments or data availability.
#### Solutions:
- **Use *spikes***: The team could create *spikes*: items in the backlog that
provide time for research and discovery.
They are either timeboxed or their definition of done is when the specified research objectives are met.
- **Do the least understood work first**: Start with the most uncertain tasks and increment from there.
- **Deviate from the plan**: The sprint plan is not set in stone,
teams should 'negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog' when needed.
- **Relax "Definition of Done"**: To keep a fast discovery pace,
exploratory work doesn't need to meet the same strict criteria as regular tasks.

----------------------------------------------------
### Cultural challenge
A scientist is traditionally used to working individually in an isolated silo.
Also management might be hesitant to let teams self-manage.
Given this individualistic culture it is often intimidating to start with Agile practices.
#### Solutions:
- **Implement flexibly**: You should fit the methodology to the way of working.
'Process-rigidity is the antithesis of agility.'
- **Emphasize the "why"**: Focus on the "why" for the change to agile instead of
"what" to do to make the change.

----------------------------------------------------
### Waterfall project setup challenge
Scientific projects are often setup in long-term project timelines following a
Waterfall method.
#### Solutions:
- Clear communication is key. Inform your collaborators on your way of working and update them frequently.
- Actually projects that follow the Waterfall method often do not make the targets set out at the start of the project.

----------------------------------------------------
### Large-scale projects challenge
Emergent design in iterative sprints does not always lead to the best large-scale functionality.
#### Solutions
-  It makes sense to do a few design sprints to set out the bigger plan before embarking on a project.
- The [Architectural Runway](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/architectural-runway/)
approach revolves around more large-scale "intentional architectures".

----------------------------------------------------
### Team dedication challenge
Agile is often explained with the idea of a team fully dedicated to a single project.
In academia team members are often involved in numerous projects in and outside of the team.
#### Solutions:
- **Implement flexibly**: Again: You should fit the methodology to the way of working.
Start from where your team's activities do overlap and where teamwork seems most beneficial.
- **Keeping track**: Experiment and iterate on ideas to find the best way to keep track of
the different projects in your team. You can start with a Kanban board and backlog for each project seperately.

----------------------------------------------------
### Product owner challenge
For a team running multiple research projects, who acts as product owner?
#### Solutions:
- Each project has its own 'project owner' (usually a team member) that takes
the role of product owner for that project.

------------------------------------------------
### Distributed expertise challenge
In Agile methodologies it is often assumed that a task can be picked up by any team member.
However, in science different team members often have specialized in certain domains or technologies,
and it makes more sense to assign specific tasks to members with a specific expertise.
#### Solutions:
- Not everyone has to be involved in everything!
- Be explicit and open in each team members expertise and how that fits best to the different projects.
